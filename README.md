# Welcome to CLETeenHack 2016!
This year we'll be building a voting app for high school students.

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started writing code for this project is to
create an account on [Cloud9 IDE](https://c9.io).  Cloud9 is a tool that
lets you write code and run it within a web browser.

Once you are signed up, you'll need to talk to your mentor about forking
this repository and creating a workspace in Cloud9 that connects to your
fork.

Once you have your code in Cloud9 you'll need to run the setup to create
the database and insert seed data.  Within a bash shell run this command:
```
gem install bundler
sh ./script/setup_cloud9
```

## Contributing
Once assignments are made and you've done some work that you would like
to have pushed to the main repository, you can work with your mentor on
opening a Pull Request to get your changes merged.

After your changes are reviewed and merged, we'll deploy your changes to
the latest staging server here: https://vote-for-stuff.herokuapp.com

Happy Coding!
